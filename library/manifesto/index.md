title: "The Aretecratic Manifesto"
in_nav: true
---
This part of the book is a companion piece to the book: ‘Let’s Kill Capitalism’ and it is about the rules and regulations which will be put in place by creating an Aretecratic system of government, if partisan politics were still relevant under this system you could consider this The Aretecratic manifesto. This is where the ‘meat’ of Aretecracy lies but it’s difficult to make rules and regulations sound interesting so I apologise in advance if this part is boring.

Please note: Making this section a bit nicer is on my to-do list.
