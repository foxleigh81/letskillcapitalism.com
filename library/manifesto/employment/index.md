As mentioned in ‘Let’s kill capitalism’, Employment is optional under Aretecracy. Citizens are free to spend their days doing whatever they wish.

Employment will come with some considerable benefits and whilst living relatively comfortably will be more than possible for those who are happy to do so, employment will provide people with a higher quality of life due to an increased allowance and the ability to potentially earn more Grace.

## The four types of employment:

### Flexible

Employers who wish to offer flexible hours will be given a computer system which will allow them to publicly post roles and available hours online. Anyone who has previously been approved to work at that company may apply for those hours and work for that time.

Employees who choose to work flexible contracts may work for as few or as many companies as they wish and can pick and choose their hours as they like. Provided the availability is there, of course.

### Part-time

Employees who wish to work part time will work for one or more companies for up to 20 hours a week in total. These hours will be fixed by the employer.

If an employee exceeds these hours, either at the same company or via multiple companies, they will be then considered full-time employees.

### Full-time

Full-time employees work a fixed number of hours for one or more companies which can vary between 20 and 40 hours per week. Full time employees (and flexible employees on weeks they choose to work 20 hours or more) will receive an extra 10% bump in their allowance on top of any allowance increase normally awarded to them through their choice in career.

### Over-time

Any employees who choose to work more than 40 hours per week for one or more companies will be considered over-time employees. They will receive the 10% allowance increase for any hours up to 40 hours and an extra 10% on top of that for any hours above 40.

No employee can be forced to work hours they did not originally agree to when signing their employment contract and over-time hours cannot be forced upon any worker.

If the workload regularly requires more than 40 working hours per week for one job then it is advisable that the employer keep a flexible hours schedule open in order to cover this.

 

## Working for the government

In addition to the employment types listed above, there will also be another way to increase your level of personal income: Work for the government directly.

Infrastructure jobs (jobs which keep the country running) and direct government work will be jobs which will earn more grace and even a bit more in the way of income allowance. This will incentivise the population to help keep the country running.
