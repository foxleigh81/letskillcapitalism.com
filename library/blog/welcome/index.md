excerpt: Capitalism is the cause of almost every injustice in this world, it fuels war, it allows people to suffer and starve and pushes innocent people out of their countries. Capitalism has had its time. Let’s replace it with something that can work, let’s replace it with something that uses human nature as something to improve society instead of destroy it. Let’s kill capitalism.
