title: "How I made the ultimate home office"

I've been trying to get my home office *just right* for years and never quite got to where I want it. This month, however we had some plumbing work done which required me to partially dismantle my office which was a great excuse to give it an overhaul and this time, I feel like I nailed it. My I present to you, the ultimate home office.

<!-- end -->

So, I had a few goals in mind when I was trying to plan this out:

- I didn't want to replace my furniture (or even move it if I could help it) as I like what I have and where it is placed.
- I wanted to be able to have cold water on tap in my office as I'm terrible at remembering to drink water
- I wanted to be able to control pretty much everything in my office from my desk
- I wanted it to be a fun relaxation space / man cave as well.

There were also one or two things I want to do which I just don't have the time to do right now, (repainting my desk, properly repainting the walls as they are looking a bit worn and a few other bits and bobs.) I'll do these at a later date. So I guess technically that makes this the **penultimate** home office (but that's not a catchy title).

Annoyingly, I forgot to take any before pictures, I wanted this to be a transformation post but instead we'll have to settle for a 'how I did it' post. I did manage to do a 'post dismantle' shot so that will have to do for a 'before'.

Also, total disclosure, some of this is cheating. A few things that I'm putting in this post I have had in place for a while. However I never blogged about them before and I think they are cool and could help other people set them up so I'm including them here.

I'll break it down into steps so you can just take the parts which you would find interesting:

## Desk

The first part of the office upgrade is my desk. I have an old Ikea Galant office set which has served me well for many years. I've modified it a bit in the past to allow for an extension without having to use Ikeas massive legs which kinda get in the way. 

I'd love to repaint it as I'm really bored of the grey colour and it is starting to look a bit tatty but that would mean I also need to repaint my pedestal, shelves and cabinet and quite frankly, I have neither the time nor the inclination at this point.

However what I can do is to clear some space on it by modifying it a bit more.

### Arm mounted displays

I'm pretty excited about this step. I've had arm mounted monitors before but they were incredibly rigid and to be honest, didn't work well for me at all as I could never get the angle right. This time however I've gone for proper full-motion ones, I bought them at a pretty good price from Amazon. I have bought three different sets:

- 1 x Dual monitor mounting arm
- 2 x Single monitor mounting arm

The reason for this is that I couldn't get a triple monitor mounting arm, so I bought a dual one and a single one, I also saw in a YouTube video recently that you can attach laptop mounts to the same display mount arms and it looked amazing, so I definitely want to give that a try.

### Single button switching of everything

So having 3 monitors is great but if you want to switch between two computers then it's a bit of a pain, the monitors I have require 3 button presses on each monitor to switch to the correct input and then I need to press another button to switch my keyboard and mouse to use the correct machine.

I looked at KVMs which supported both HDMI and three monitors and they were eye-wateringly expensive. Fortunately I found a solution.

I bought a [triple display docking station](https://amzn.to/2C8Q0P2), this docking station uses [DisplayLink technology](https://www.displaylink.com/) to connect all of my displays to a computer via a single USB3 port. This allows me to combine it with a USB3 Switch to switch all three of my displays, my speakers and my USB3 HUB (which has my keyboard and mouse connected to it) **all by pressing a single button**

I even had my network connection running through the dock for a while, however I don't recommend you do this as it confuses the hell out of the machines, still better giving them a dedicated network connection.

Now if that sounds too good to be true, then you're kinda right. There were some caveats, although I'd say none of them outweigh the awesomeness of the setup:

#### 1) My Mac needed a special adaptor

I have one of those newer macs which only has USB-C ports, so I needed to buy a dongle which I could use to connect my dock. However, this is one of those things I did a while ago and since then, Dell have released a [newer version of their docking station](https://amzn.to/2EVHrJa) which supports USB-C, I've never used it so I can't confirm that it resolves the issue but I certainly imagine that it would.

#### 2) It's not amazing for gaming

My gaming machine has a decent graphics card in it, DisplayLink tell me that they don't actually do any graphical processing, they just display the image sent from my machine, so *in theory* my graphics card is still doing all the work, however that's not necessarily the case, I know that modern machines can sometimes attempt to process graphics via the CPU itself when connected to a USB display and indeed, if I'm connected to my monitors via DisplayLink, I cannot access the NVidia control panel and some more modern games have a little bit of lag. 

The workaround I have for this is that I've set up an [HDMI switch](https://amzn.to/2TsazR9) that I can use to directly connect my gaming machine to my monitor when I want to play a more modern game. This means if I want to work on my PC or if I want to play a less graphically intense game (which, as an indie game fan, is more common for me anyway) then the DisplayLink connection works fine but if I want to play something that does utilise the full power of my machine then I'll hit the HDMI switch and my central monitor will disconnect from the DisplayLink and switch directly to my PC connection.

#### 3) You need DisplayLink drivers

At the time of writing this article, I've not connected a machine to my dock without having to install drivers on it first, I guess DisplayLink isn't popular enough to be preinstalled on any major OS's, I've tried this on MacOs, Windows 10 and various flavours of Linux.

It's not an issue once the drivers are installed but it does mean that the setup process for this will require you to manually connect your machine to a display whilst you install the drivers.

#### 4) DisplayLink kind of suck as a company

Last year when I first set this system up, it worked flawlessly, then I updated my Mac to the Mojave and suddenly my displays stopped working. Luckily I had a backup and was able to roll-back the upgrade but it's important to check the [DisplayLink forums](https://www.displaylink.org/forum/) before updating your software/hardware as they are notoriously bad at not keeping up with software releases and take quite some time to fix them.

When I checked the forums I discovered that the issue didn't start with Mojave, later updates of High Sierra even had the DisplayLink issue and [many users](https://www.displaylink.org/forum/showthread.php?t=65890) were unable to use their external displays properly for months before a fix was released.

#### 5) If the displays go to sleep, sometimes they don't come back on

This was really annoying for me at first as I had to unplug the dock from my computer and re-plug it back in again to get it working. However it turns out that just flipping my USB switch between the two machines and back again really quickly also did the job so this turned out to be only a minor annoyance.

### Instant speaker switching

I have three different audio outputs in my office now:

1) My desktop PC speakers
2) My Headphones
3) My surround sound system

I'm pretty lazy, so whereas I'm sure most people don't mind just plugging their headphones in, I personally can't be bothered, plus I knew I wanted to add a home theatre setup to my office at some point so I set about concocting a plan to be able to instantly switch between any of my three inputs.

Turns out it was really easy! Thanks to my dock setup from above, my audio source can be instantly switched from my Mac or my PC, so that was already sorted, now I just needed to get it to feed that source to one of three devices.

I had an old [input switcher](https://amzn.to/2TodUk1) from a few years ago before I had a receiver which I used to switch between audio input devices in my living room. I was curious to know if it could work both ways, I opened it up and looked at the circuit and saw no reason why it couldn't work out of the box. So I gave it a shot: I plugged my dock output to the port labeled `output` on the switch and connected my headphones, speaker and receiver to `aux 1`, `aux 2` and `aux 3`,  respectively, pressed play on my Mac and lo-and-behold, sound came out of my headphones, switched to `aux 2` and my PC speakers started playing the music, switched to `aux 3` and yep, [DMX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGx6K90TmCI) in surround sound (scared the shit out of my cats).
